# MAFI: A Multi-Modal Attention Framework Integrating Molecular Subgraphs and Homologous Sequence Features for Drug-Target Affinity Prediction


 MAFI: A Multi-Modal Attention Framework that combines protein homology sequence generation with multi-scale protein graph construction to enhance Drug-Target Affinity prediction. It uses the ESM3 model for creating homology sequences, enriching protein sequence diversity perception and improving generalization. The multi-step protein subgraph mapping captures structural info at different scales. Along with BILSTM and attention mechanisms, MAFI offers high interpretability, making it a credible tool for drug discovery.

## üß† File list
vocabulary_builder.py: Used to build a vocabulary, containing the TorchVocab, Vocab, and WordVocab classes, as well as the main function to generate and save the vocabulary.

utils.py: Provides a set of utility functions, including model training, prediction, and performance metric calculation.

molecular_interaction.py: Defines the MolecularInteractionDataset class for processing molecular and protein interaction datasets.

main.py: The main program file, containing the workflow for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

interaction_network.py: Defines the model architecture, including the SpatialFeatureAggregator, HeterogeneousAttentionLayer, MolecularGraphNetwork, and CrossModalInteractionNet classes.

graphmaker.py: Provides functions for constructing molecular and protein contact graphs.

generate_homologous.py: Contains functions for generating homologous protein sequences and related utility functions.

These files collectively form a multi-modal attention framework for drug-target affinity prediction.


## üìÅ Dataset
To ensure the accuracy of the model, we utilized six datasets: Davis, KIBA, PDBbind, Toxcast, Binding DB, and Metz. 

"Davis_processed.csv" records protein-drug molecule binding affinity data, which is used for model training and validation. 

‚ÄòKIBA_processed.csv‚Äô integrates multi-source data and records ligand-receptor protein binding constants. 

‚ÄòPDBbind_processed.csv‚Äô provides three-dimensional structures and binding affinity data for protein-ligand complexes. 

‚ÄòToxcast_processed.csv‚Äô covers toxicological data for various chemicals. 

"BindingDB_processed.csv" contains binding data for protein-ligand complexes. 

‚ÄòMetz_processed.csv‚Äô is used for toxicity prediction studies of compounds.

Multiple datasets fully demonstrate the model's generalization capability.


Before commencing model training, we employed the ESM3 model to predict contact maps. The ESM3 model can predict the spatial proximity relationships between atoms in protein-ligand complexes based on protein sequence information, thereby generating corresponding contact maps. These contact maps include important details such as contact locations, contact types, and contact strengths, providing the model training with rich structural feature data and aiding the model in better understanding the interaction patterns between proteins and ligands.
The generated protein-ligand complex contact maps should be properly stored in a folder named ‚Äò{dataset_name}_npy_contact_maps‚Äô to enable quick and accurate access and reading during model training, ensuring the efficiency and consistency of the entire model training process and laying a solid foundation for improving model performance.

## ‚ú® Operating System
SeqMG-RPI was developed on a Linux environment with CUDA 12.4

Hardware: Two NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090Ôºà24GÔºâ

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup
You'll need to run the following commands in order to run the codes
```
conda env create -f requirements.yml   # Create environment and install dependencies
```
it will download all the required libraries
```
conda activate mafi  # Activate environment mafi
```
The code file can now be run.

## üîó Install ESM Model

If you want to install the ESM model, you can use the following command:

```
pip install fair-esm
```

```
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm.git
```

If you need to use a specific version of the ESM model, it will be automatically downloaded when you run the code for the first time. If the automatic download fails, you can manually download the model file from the official ESM model repository and place it in the appropriate directory.

Next,you need to follow the same steps to download the corresponding esm3 weight file in 

```
https://hf-mirror.com/EvolutionaryScale/esm3-sm-open-v1/tree/main/data
```
so that you can generate protein homology later.


## üñ•Ô∏è Run Code
