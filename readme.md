# MAFI: A Multi-Modal Attention Framework Integrating Molecular Subgraphs and Homologous Sequence Features for Drug-Target Affinity Prediction.


MAFI: A Multi-Modal Attention Framework that combines protein homology sequence generation with multi-scale protein graph construction to enhance Drug-Target Affinity prediction. It uses the ESM3 model for creating homology sequences, enriching protein sequence diversity perception and improving generalization. The multi-step protein subgraph mapping captures structural info at different scales. Along with BILSTM and attention mechanisms, MAFI offers high interpretability, making it a credible tool for drug discovery.

## Dataset
For the convenience of the experiment, we utilized six datasets: Davis, KIBA, PDBbind, Toxcast, Binding DB, and Metz. ‘Davis_processed.csv’ records protein-drug molecule binding affinity data, which is used for model training and validation. ‘KIBA_processed.csv’ integrates multi-source data and records ligand-receptor protein binding constants. ‘PDBbind_processed.csv’ provides three-dimensional structures and binding affinity data for protein-ligand complexes. ‘Toxcast_processed.csv’ covers toxicological data for various chemicals. ‘BindingDD_processed.csv’ contains binding data for protein-ligand complexes. ‘Metz_processed.csv’ is used for toxicity prediction studies of compounds.
Multiple datasets fully demonstrate the model's generalization capability.


Before commencing model training, we employed the ESM3 model to predict contact maps. The ESM3 model can predict the spatial proximity relationships between atoms in protein-ligand complexes based on protein sequence information, thereby generating corresponding contact maps. These contact maps include important details such as contact locations, contact types, and contact strengths, providing the model training with rich structural feature data and aiding the model in better understanding the interaction patterns between proteins and ligands.
The generated protein-ligand complex contact maps should be properly stored in a folder named ‘{dataset_name}_npy_contact_maps’ to enable quick and accurate access and reading during model training, ensuring the efficiency and consistency of the entire model training process and laying a solid foundation for improving model performance.
